      <h1> Knitting Around the World </h1>
      <p> Knitting as a practice of creating textiles is found globally. It's roots are in the Arabic world where it came to Europe via Spain during the Crusades. The oldest surviving knit is a pair of Coptic socks from 11th century Egypt. Prior to this, nålbinding, a similar practice that uses one needle instead of two was used globably. The oldest textiles created useing nålbinding have been found in the Judean Desert (6580 BCE) and Denmark (4280 BCE). Knitting and nålbinding are similar because they are both knott-less ways of creating fabric using loops. After the spread of knitting, different cultures took the craft and created different folkways and traditions centered around the garments they created. Here we'll take a look at a few different examples from around the world</p>

      <h2> Scottish Knitting </h2>
     <p>  Knitting is a crucial part of Scottish folk history and the nation's identity. As a country that produces some of the finest wool, it would only be right that there was a development of several national styles. Knitting was crucial to the Scottish economy from the 18th to the 20th century.  The most prominent knit styles in Scottland come from the Shettland Islands. It is from these islands that we get Shetland lace and the Fair Isle knit style. Shetland lace is an open-work style knit that mimicks true lace. Fair Isle patterns are a form of color-work that use exactly two different colors of yarn per row to create a beautiful fabric.
